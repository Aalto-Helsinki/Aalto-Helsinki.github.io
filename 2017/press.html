		<p class="lead spacing justified">We are a student-driven team that will participate in a synthetic biology competition: International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM). In practice this means, that we are working in the lab with bacteria to which we insert DNA in order to produce an antimicrobial peptide. This peptide is efficient at killing many hospital bacteria, such as MRSA. The peptide is called dermcidin, and it is natural in the sense that it is secreted by the human sweat glands. It also has a very different working mechanism from antibiotics. This is why it is a great potential solution to combat antibiotic resistance in such applications that are in close contact with humans. This kind of solutions include wound care products, implants and surgical devices.
		</p>

		<p class="lead spacing justified">We believe that science has great potential, when practiced responsibly and safely. This especially applies to synthetic biology, as cells are incredibly complex working units, which can be used to produce complicated molecules. We are happy to comment on our project, synthetic biology, the competition or science in general. Because of this, we also intend to organize workshops and present at events, as well as create educational online material about synthetic biology, in Finnish.
