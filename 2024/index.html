            <h2>What is going on here?</h2>
            <p>The Aalto-Helsinki 2024 is a multidisciplinary team consisting of nine students from the University of Helsinki and Aalto University. Since 2014, Aalto-Helsinki has been representing the capital region of Finland in the world's largest synthetic biology competition: iGEM. Each year a new team is recruited to compete with the aim to develop an innovative and impactful synthetic biology project that advances scientific research and benefits society. Even thought the main thing is synthetic biology, the project consists of many other things that require skills beyond the lab, such as graphic designing, business skills, project management, event coordinating  and programming to make for example this website possible! During the project, each member gets to show their skills and learn a lot of new ones. <br>
            To help up in our journey, we have the support of our PIs Heli Viskari, Aalto University lecturer, Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems, and Markus Linder, Aalto University professor of Biomolecular materials. Additionally, we have been supported a lot by doctoral researcher Yin Yin from the Aalto University, Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems. <br>
            Please find a more detailed list of all of the people who have shared their time and knowledge with us to make this project possible from our wiki, which will be updated through our journey. Apart from this website, you can follow our journey on our Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook. </p>

            <h2>Our Project</h2>

            <p>Our research focuses on leveraging naturally existing adhesive proteins, such as those in mussel foot and silk, for biomedical applications. Recognizing the global cancer crisis, with new cases projected to rise by 77 % to over 35 million annually by 2050, we are addressing the urgent need for improved cancer treatments. Current chemotherapy methods often lead to severe side effecs, highlighting the necessity for more effective and precise drug delivery systems. Inspired by bio-adhesives, we develop a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-based drug delivery system aimed at enhancing the efficacy and precision of cancer therapeutics. This innovative approach aims to minimize side effects and improve patient outcomes, offering a significant advancement in the fight against cancer.

        <h2>About iGEM</h2>
            <p>International Genetically Engineered Machine, iGEM, is an international synthetic biology competition originating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Boston, USA. The iGEM competition challenges students to design and implement a project within a short time frame (around 10 months) using innovation, design, experimental work and modelling applications.

            The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic biology in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes, genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways. Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic parts.
            
            Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems. However, media and the general public still often see genetically modified organisms rather as a threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into account in our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the environment.</p>
