                    What if synthetic biology was used to engineer a solution to solve grand issues in healthcare?
                </p>

                <p class="maintext">
                        The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic biology in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes, genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways. Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic parts.
                </p>
                <p class="maintext">
                        Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems. However, media and the general public still sometimes see genetically modified organisms rather as a threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into account in our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the environment.

                    We believe that science has great potential, when practiced responsibly and safely. We are happy to comment on our project, synthetic biology, the competition or science in general. Because of this, we also intend to organize workshops and present at events, as well as create educational online material about synthetic biology, in Finnish.<br><br>
