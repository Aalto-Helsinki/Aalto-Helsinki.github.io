                    <p>The Aalto-Helsinki 2020 is a multidisciplinary team of 10 people with a shared ambition to
                        conduct a unique synthetic biology research project. With expertise in various fields, such as:
                        biosystems and biomaterials engineering, microbiology, bioinformatics, molecular biosciences,
                        chemistry, biotechnology, chemical engineering and physics, our team
                        has the capability to conduct an exceptional research project that requires multidisciplinary
                        skills, ambition, and innovation. Thus, Aalto-Helsinki is an extremely diverse team that truly
                        represents the spirit of Aalto University and University of Helsinki by bringing the various
                        fields of study together for higher value creation.</p>
                    <p>Our main advisor is Heli Viskari, Aalto University lecturer, Department of Bioproducts and
                        Biosystems. Our advising team also includes Minna Poranen, Principal Investigator at the
                        University of Helsinki, Faculty of Biological and Environmental Sciences, and Markus Linder,
                        Aalto University professor of Biomolecular Sciences.</p>
                    <p>Our aim is to design and prototype a synthetic biology project and participate in the world’s
                        largest synthetic biology competition, iGEM, in November 2020 to showcase our project among
                        other top universities in the world.</p>

                    HEALTHCARE?</h1>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an international synthetic biology
                        competition
                        originating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA. The iGEM competition
                        challenges students to design and implement a project within a short time frame using
                        innovation,
                        design, experimental work, modelling applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic
                        biology
                        in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that
                        combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes,
                        genetic
                        devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways.
                        Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM
                        competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic
                        parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems.
                        However, media and the general public still sometimes see genetically modified organisms rather
                        as a
                        threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into
                        account in
                        our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the
                        environment.
