                    <i>Vibrio natriegens</i> is challenging <i>Escherichia coli</i> as the organism of choice for research and biotechnology applications – and we’re betting on <i>V. natriegens!</i> The gram-negative marine bacteria with a generation under 10 minutes combined with the ability to produce and secrete large amounts of proteins into the growth medium makes <i>V. natriegens</i> an ideal chassis organism.<br><br>

                    Inspired by the possibilities that <i>V. natriegens</i> offers, our team Aalto-Helsinki is determined to take on the challenge of improving the bacterium’s protein <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">expression</span> and <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">secretion</span>.<br><br>
 
                    <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">Recombinant proteins</span> are widely used for biomedical research and in the pharmaceutical industry. Several methods for protein production have been established during the past decades providing aid for millions of people. However, even with today’s technologies, improved efficacy is urgent as the demand for recombinant proteins is only increasing - <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">it has been estimated that within the next 10 years half of all medicine will be biopharmaceutical, including recombinant proteins.</span><br><br>

                    Our iGEM project aims to tackle these challenges by improving the next-generation synthetic biology chassis organism <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>. Hence the name of our project VibXPresso - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization.<br><br>

                        International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) is an international synthetic biology competition originating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA. The iGEM competition challenges students to design and implement a project within a short time frame using innovation, design, experimental work, modelling applications.<br><br>
                        The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic biology in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes, genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways. Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic parts.

                        Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems. However, media and the general public still sometimes see genetically modified organisms rather as a threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into account in our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the environment.

                    We are a student-driven team that will participate in a synthetic biology competition: International Genetically Engineered Machine (<a id="link" href="https://igem.org/Main_Page">iGEM</a>).<br><br>
                    We believe that science has great potential, when practiced responsibly and safely. We are happy to comment on our project, synthetic biology, the competition or science in general. Because of this, we also intend to organize workshops and present at events, as well as create educational online material about synthetic biology, in Finnish.<br><br>
                    If you would like to interview us or write about us in the media, feel free to contact us through our team email <span style="color: rgb(6,69,173);">team@aaltohelsinki.com</span>. We are more than happy to help.<br><br>
                    Warm thanks to all who have contributed to our iGEM journey! This project would not be possible without them.
