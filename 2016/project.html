	    <h2>Fighting Against Blue-Green Algae</h2>
		<p class="lead spacing justified">Toxins produced by blue-green algae are a recurring problem in Finnish water systems every summer.
		When present in large quantities as blooms, cyanotoxins pose a significant health threat to humans
		and animals. The goal of our project is to <b>sense</b> the most common cyanobacterial toxins and <b>degrade</b> them by producing a cyanotoxin-degrading
		enzyme with genetically modified yeast.</p>
		
		<p class="lead spacing justified">The final product of our project would be a kit containing a sensor device and a degradation capsule. The sensor would indicate the presence of harmful toxins in the
		sample and the capsule could then be used to detoxify water as needed. This kit would enable the safe use of lake water as sauna, shower or animal drinking
		water.</p>

		<div class="spacing">
		<h2>Synthetic Biology</h2>
		<p class="lead spacing justified">The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase understanding of synthetic biology in Finland and
		around the world. Synthetic biology is a new field of science and technology that combines biology with engineering.
		The basic principle is to design new genes, genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="spacing">
		<h2>Is This Safe?</h2>
		<p class="lead spacing justified"> The concept of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is often presented with caution in the media.
		We are working responsibly and ethically to try and change the negative image created by GMOs. One of our main considerations 
		is for our solutions to be safe also outside laboratory settings.
