                    Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme Protein Expression and Secretion System Optimization
                </p>

                <p class="maintext">
                    After years of domination, <i>E. coli</i> has finally faced a challenge with the emergence of <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>, a gram-negative marine bacteria that possesses the potential to become the next generation chassis organism for synthetic biology as <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">it can divide at its best at seven minute intervals.</span><br><br>

                    Inspired by the possibilities that <i>V. natriegens</i> offers, our team Aalto-Helsinki is determined to take on the challenge of improving the bacterium in protein expression and secretion, utilizing the putative signal sequence that <i>V. natriegens</i> has while also producing bacteriophage tools for the strain. We aim to produce single-chain variable fragments (scFv) as a proof-of-concept that <i>V. natriegens</i> can be utilized as <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">a productive cell factory.</span> Our motivation behind our project is to advance synthetic biology and the production of proteins for the benefit of science & iGEM community, and for the society at large.<br><br>

                    Our project aims to research and <span style="color: rgb(68, 141, 125);">improve the protein expression</span> of <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>, a gram-negative marine bacteria which has an immense potential to be the next-generation workhorse for biotechnology and synthetic biology due to its incredibly fast dividing rate (seven minutes at best). We strive to develop <i>V. natriegens</i> as a cell factory in versatile protein production, and to enhance the bacterium’s secretion pathways to secrete proteins directly into the medium, especially via the twin-arginine translocation (tat) pathway.<br><br>

                    To demonstrate the potential of <i>V. natriegens</i> as a secretive cell factory, we plan to express single-chain variable fragments (scFv) of antigens or antibodies. ScFvs are commonly used in flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and as antigen-binding domains of artificial T-cell receptors. ScFvs have also great potential in constructing immunotoxins, therapeutic gene delivery, and anticancer intrabodies for therapeutic purposes.<br><br>

                    We also plan to prove an identified putative secretion signal that <i>V. natriegens</i> possesses, and to define the secretion pathway it utilises, in addition to researching how it affects the protein secretion.<br><br>

                    In addition, we plan to try out infecting <i>V. natriegens</i> with bacteriophages, to see if phages could serve as a possible integration, lysis and mutation tool in the future with <i>V. natriegens</i>.<br>

                    What if synthetic biology was used to engineer a solution to solve grand issues in healthcare?

                <p class="maintext">
                        The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic biology in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes, genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways. Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic parts.
                </p>
                <p class="maintext">
                        Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems. However, media and the general public still sometimes see genetically modified organisms rather as a threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into account in our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the environment.
