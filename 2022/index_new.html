                <div class="description">
                    <p>Are you looking for an interesting and meaningful project for next year? Do you want a chance to create and pursue your own ideas in research?</p>
                    <p>We are now recruiting <strong>Aalto University and University of Helsinki BSc and MSc students</strong> to form a new iGEM team to represent 
                        Finland in the world’s largest synthetic biology competition iGEM held next year in Paris (if the situation next Autumn allows). 
                        The Aalto-Helsinki team will design, develop and execute their own research project from scratch and present their results in the 
                        Giant Jamboree in November 2022.</p>
                    <p>Being a part of an iGEM team allows you to plan your own research project from scratch in three phases. In spring you will get to know your 
                        team members and decide on the project you will try to develop during the summer. Team will also reach out to companies and gather funding. 
                        The summer consists of practical work and testing your design. In autumn you will present your project and compete with other iGEM teams for 
                        the Grand Prize, as well as other Track and Special Awards.</p>
                    <p>To get a better idea what an iGEM project could be please take a look at the previous teams' wiki pages and Aalto-Helsinki social media found at the bottom of the page and promotion video of Aalto-Helsinki 2021.</p>

                    <p>The Aalto-Helsinki 2021 is an international team of 10 people with a shared ambition to
                        conduct a unique synthetic biology research project. With expertise in various fields of biosciences and technology, 
                        our team has the capability to conduct an exceptional research project that requires multidisciplinary
                        skills, ambition, and innovation. Thus, Aalto-Helsinki is an extremely diverse team that truly
                        represents the spirit of Aalto University and University of Helsinki by bringing the various
                        fields of study together for higher value creation.</p>
                    <p>Our advising team consists of Pricipal Investigators Heli Viskari, Aalto University lecturer, Department of Bioproducts and
                        Biosystems, and Markus Linder, Aalto University professor of Biomolecular Sciences. Additionally, we have supporting project advisors
                        Dr. Ville Paavilainen, Institute of Biotechnology, and Sesilja Aranko, staff scientist at the Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems, Aalto University.</p>
                    <p>Our aim is to design and prototype a synthetic biology project and participate in the world’s
                        largest synthetic biology competition, iGEM, in November 2021 to showcase our project among
                        other top universities in the world.

                    <p>International Genetically Engineered Machine 
                        <a href="https://igem.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">iGEM</a> 
                        is an international synthetic biology competition
                        originating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, USA. The iGEM competition
                        challenges students to design and implement a project within a short time frame using
                        innovation, design, experimental work and modelling applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>The broader purpose of our project is to promote and increase the understanding of synthetic
                        biology in Finland and around the world. Synthetic biology is a field of science and technology that
                        combines biology with engineering principles. The basic principle is to design new genes,
                        genetic devices, metabolic routes and entire organisms to create novel products and production pathways.
                        Standardization is also a key component of this process, which is why one goal of the iGEM
                        competition is to maintain the "BioBrick part registry" - a library of standardized genetic
                        parts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Synthetic biology has the potential to provide valuable solutions to many of today's problems.
                        However, media and the general public still sometimes see genetically modified organisms rather
                        as a threat than an opportunity. We work responsibly and take safety and ethics carefully into
                        account in our project design and laboratory work. We conduct research that is safe for us and the
                        environment.

                        We are a student-driven team that will participate in a synthetic biology competition:
                        International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM).
                        We believe that science has great potential, if practiced responsibly and safely. We are
                        happy to discuss our project, synthetic biology, the competition or science in general. You
                        are welcome to reach us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aaltohelsinki_igem/"

                        We also intend to organize workshops and present at events, as long as current situation
                        allows it.
